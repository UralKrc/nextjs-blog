    description: 'In this example, the getServerSideProps function fetches data for the dynamic route (postId). The data is then passed as props to the Post component. These examples cover basic scenarios, and you can build upon them based on the specific requirements of your project. Remember to adapt the code to suit your application structure and needs.'
